<h1>Import Maintenance Database</h1>
<p>The maintenance database file to be imported must be in Excel *.xlsx format.</p>
<p>By default, existing data will be replaced with the imported data.  That means all existing maintenance items will be
   removed before importing the file.</p>
<p>If the "Replace" checkbox is unticked, the imported items will be merged with data already in the database.
   This is a more complicated operation and should only be used if some items or meetings have been removed from
   the spreadsheet to make it less unwieldy.  Use of this feature is discouraged.</p>
